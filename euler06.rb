# 6. Sum Square Difference. 

# "The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385
# 
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)** 2 = 55**2 = 3025
# 
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
# 
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum."
